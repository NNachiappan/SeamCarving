# SeamCarving in C++

An implementation of the Seam Carving algorithm using C++ and OpenCV.

Seam Carving is an image resizing algorithm that preserves the scale of objects in images. This was first proposed by Avidan and Shamir[1].
The algorithm finds vertical seams (vertical paths) in an image that are unimportant.
Seams are found by using edge detection and finding a vertical path that minimises the intersection of edges.

## Examples
| Original | 50% scaled (Seam Carving) | 50% scaled (Bicubic)
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ![space](SeamCarving/images/space.jpg)  | ![space50](SeamCarving/images/space50.jpg)  | ![space50bicubic](SeamCarving/images/space50bicubic.jpg)
| ![squirrel](SeamCarving/images/squirrel.jpg)  | ![squirrel50](SeamCarving/images/squirrel50.jpg)  | ![squirrel50bicubic](SeamCarving/images/squirrel50bicubic.jpg)

Example of a seam in an image to be removed:\
